misc scratch notes:


Validating the Image
    
    The firmware image should be validated before use. This is done as follows:
        compute the CRC-32 checksum of the image, excluding the last 4 bytes (so bytes 0 through N-4, where N is the length of the file.)
        compare this computed checksum with the value stored in the last 4 bytes of the firmware image
        if the image valid, the checksum values will be identical.
